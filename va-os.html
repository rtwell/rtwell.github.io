        <h1>Case study: VA Online Scheduling Tool</h1>
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>VA Online Scheduling Tool (VAOS) is tool Veterans use to schedule basic healthcare appointments online. The previous tool lived on a separate URL, didn't use the VA.gov design system, didn't work on a mobile phone, had unique login credentials, and most importantly, delivered a broken UX to Veterans.

        <h2>The solution</h2>
        <p>Migrate the legacy tool onto the new VA.gov tech stack, which allowed other VA.gov pages to easily integrate the tool and use the same login credentials as the rest of the site.

        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>My responsibilities included working with multiple stakeholders to gain alignment on project goals, including getting buy-in from different department heads inside of VA. I worked with contractors and engineers to ensure VAOS would be able to mirror its current functionality, as well as develop a roll out plan for implementation. Additonally, I was responsible for converting the legacy tool with the VA.gov design system
