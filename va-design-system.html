        <h1>VA Design System</h1>
        <h2 class="h2-simple">The problem</h2>
        <p>When I detailed to VA via USDS in early 2018, the <a href="https://design.va.gov/" target="_blank">VA design system</a> was in its nacent stages. While it borrowed its styles and framework from an older version of the USWDS <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Web Design System</a>, it had limited components and was not widely adopted by the VA as an organization. It also lacked comprehensive documentation and was difficult for users (typically government contractors) to contribute to the design system.

        <h2 class="h2-simple">The solution</h2>
        <p>Our mission was to expand the VA.gov design system so that users could easily and quickly deliver digital services to Veterans. We accomplished this by adding new components as needed, vetted by the design system team for accessibilty.We made it easier for teams to work with and contribute to the design system by implemention agnostic web components and creating a contribution process (in the form of a <a href="https://design.va.gov/about/maturity-scale" target="_blank">maturity scale</a>).

        <h2 class="h2-simple">My role</h2>
        <p>As design lead of VA.gov as a platform, my role on the design system team was to review proposals of new components (how they are used, what data do we have that justifies a new component or pattern rather than a current version), create new components and patterns to expand the system. I also reviewed documentation submitted by other designers and developers. </p>
